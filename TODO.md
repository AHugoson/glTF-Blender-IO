- [X] frame_step to be tested correctly
- [X] remove export_keys file
- [ ] check fbx simplify curve
- [X] replace some gltf_selected by gltf_baked_animation
- [X] At import, both SK and TRS anim are active. Shouldn't active only the first anim in gltf file?
- [X] Make a system to bake any property (for future KHR_animation_pointer)
- [X] Cut animation when negative frame is not really possible when not sampled... --> force to_be_sampled?
- [X] names : baked/sampled
- [X] do we need to bake sk? Are drivers on sk detected as animation or not? If driver is the only case ???
- [X] cache system merge between bone/object/sk/drivers
- [ ] check @cache on functions
- [X] Rename gather_object_bake_animation_sampler to gather_object_sampled_animation_sampler
- [X] nom des fichiers _samplers ou _sampler
- [ ] Optim option for SK?
- [X] fcurve on armature itself + bones : One or 2 animation created in master? --> Only 1
- [X] animation generate_extras
- [X] restore drivers
- [ ] slide for fcurve ??? (negative frame & looping animation)
- [X] TODOCACHEANIM -> resetting cache
- [X] TODOEXTENSIONANIM -> all hooks
- [ ] Reset SK values when not keys
- [ ] Reset bone to default values
- [X] Export multiple action on same track --> Not doing it
